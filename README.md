# DARRIN IM PORTFOLIO PROJECT

## Introduction:
> The project is aimed to display my work in a clean and elegant fashion. Different mood settings are set to switch between various color schemes based on the mood the user selects. Navigation links are located at the top of the page and turn into a hamburger menu for mobile users. Smooth scroll allows for easy access to various locations in the page.

## Technologies:
> My portfolio uses primarily HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Frameworks include bootstrap for portfolio carousel. I also used the Google Sheets API to display my work in the carousel.

## Minimum Viable Product
> My MVP will feature a clean simple layout that is responsive to all devices. I will have an About Me, Projects, and Contact Me sections that can all be easily accessed from the top navigation bar. The navigation bar has a smooth scroll added on that will quickly take users to the selected areas. The Projects portion of my page will feature a bootstrap carousel set to a timer that will use Google Sheets API to allow for continuous easy updates from an excel spreadsheet.

### Screenshots of Code Snippets

#### The following two code snippets are by far what I am most proud of in this entire project. It came directly from what I have learned in the program and it was extraordinarily satisfying to have something directly apply in that sense. I am very proud because this code is entirely my own. I have learned so much about JavaScript, the importance of planning ahead, and an almost infinite amount of lessons of programming in general from just these 50 lines of code. There were many challenges that I faced while implementing this. When I attempted the first loop, I simply had it change the background color of the UL as a proof of concept. It worked, and I happily went along my way believing that since I had proven it worked in one area, it would be simple to implement it on the rest. While it was, I was incorrect that it would apply to everything, and all the styling that I had done for just one theme would have to then be changed for the rest. In addition to that, I could only target one area at a time, so I had to produce more variables to target additional areas. I am very excited to come up with a more efficient method of setting different themes.
