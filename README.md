# DARRIN IM PORTFOLIO PROJECT

##Introduction:
> The project is aimed to display my work in a clean and elegant fashion. Different mood settings are set to switch between various color schemes based on the mood the user selects. Navigation links are located at the top of the page and turn into a hamburger menu for mobile users. Smooth scroll allows for easy access to various locations in the page.

##Technologies:
> My portfolio uses primarily HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Frameworks include bootstrap for portfolio carousel. I also used the Google Sheets API to display my work in the carousel.

##Minimum Viable Product
> My MVP will feature a clean simple layout that is responsive to all devices. I will have an About Me, Projects, and Contact Me sections that can all be easily accessed from the top navigation bar. The navigation bar has a smooth scroll added on that will quickly take users to the selected areas. The Projects portion of my page will feature a bootstrap carousel set to a timer that will use Google Sheets API to allow for continuous easy updates from an excel spreadsheet.
